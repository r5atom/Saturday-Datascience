This is distinct from high/raised floor, a bus deck design that requires climbing one or more steps to access the interior floor that is placed at a higher height.

TPMS can be divided into two different types - direct and indirect. Direct TPMS employ pressure sensors on each wheel, either internal or external. The sensors physically measure the tire pressure in each tire and report it to the vehicle's instrument cluster or a corresponding monitor. Indirect TPMS does not use physical pressure sensors but measure air pressures by monitoring individual wheel rotational speeds and other signals available outside of the tire itself.</p>;Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Type;Active Safety System;;;TPMS;https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/getvehiclevariablevalueslist/168?format=json
